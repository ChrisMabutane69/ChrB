<body style="background-image:url('globe.jpg')">
<p1>My investigation shows that many people became victims of fake news just because they dont know how to identify 
news that are not real, so i am going elaborate ways to identify fake news.</p1>
<u><h1 align="center" size=12>HOW CAN YOU IDENTIFY FAKE NEWS</h1></u>
<ol type="square">
<img src="spot fake news.jpg" align="right" height=300 width=300 alt="spot fake news">

<li>Consider the source (to understand its mission and purpose)</li>
<li>Read beyond the headline (to understand the whole story)</li>
<li>Check the authors (to see if they are real credible)</li>
<li>Assess the supporting sources (to ensure they support the claims)</li>
<li>Check the date of publication (to see if the story is relevant and up to date)</li>
<li>Ask if it is a joke (to determine if it meant to be satire)</li>
<li>Review your own biases (to see if they are affecting your judgement)</li>
<li>Ask experts (to get information from independent people with knowledge)</li>

<u><h2>Why do fake news seem to spread faster than real news</h2></u>
<ol type="square">
<li>Now a study in science finds that false news or fake news spreads much more quickly than real news-and it seems to be humans, more than bots, who are responsible for the imbalance</li>
<li>People like to share what they think will make them cool and/ or knowledgeable. Ironically, spreading false news may help them achieve this sensation.</li>
<li>What makes to spread fake more faster is that people like to share them in social networks for different reasons</li>

<h2><u>What can be done to stop fake news?</h2></u>
<ol type="circle">
<li>In order to maintain an open democratic system, it is important that government, businesses and consumers work together to solve these problems.
Government should promote news literacy and strong professional journalism in their societies.</li>
<li>The news industry must provide high-quality journalism in order to build public trust and correct fake news and disinformation without legitimizing them.</li>
<li>Technology companies should invest in tools that identify fake news, reduce financial incentives for those who profit from disinformation, and improve online accountability.</li>
<li>Educational institutions should make informing people about news literacy a high priority.</li>
<li>Finally, individuals should follow a diversity of news source, and sceptical of what they <b><u>read and watch</b></u></li>
